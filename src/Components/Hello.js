import React from 'react';

function Hello() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* write anything you want, between here and the closing div tag.  Be fancy or not, I don't care. */}
      <h2>Hi Michael!</h2>
      <h1>Write me a message!</h1>
      <p>
        You can write these things in html tags like h1, h2, p,
        whatever. (You might have noticed this is within a paragraph
        tag)
      </p>
      Or just write stuff without any html tags or styling. I truly
      don't care. (This isn't in any tag -- just text. Totally fine.)
      <h3>Your turn! :-)</h3>
      {/* Just don't go beyond this line.  For now.  Eventually you'll go far beyond these borders.  But not now. */}
    </div>
  );

export default Hello;
